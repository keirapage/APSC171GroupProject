Hello! If you can read this you've done everything right!

Welcome to Github. We're using this since its very easy to make changes to a group project as individuals without having to download a new zip file every time and allows us to keep track of changes and keep track of old versions of things. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you so much! - Yvette
